Description: Digital Forensics Virtual File System (dfVFS).
 dfVFS, or Digital Forensics Virtual File System, provides read-only access to
 file-system objects from various storage media types and file formats. The goal
 of dfVFS is to provide a generic interface for accessing file-system objects,
 for which it uses several back-ends that provide the actual implementation of
 the various storage media types, volume systems and file systems.
