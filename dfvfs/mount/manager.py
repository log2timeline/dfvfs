"""The path specification mount point manager.

The mount point manager allows to "mount" one path specification onto another.
This allows dfVFS to expose complex path specifications in a way closer to
the original system interpretation.

E.g. the path specification:
type=OS, location=/home/myuser/myimages/image.qcow2
type=QCOW
type=TSK_PARTITION, location=/p1
type=TSK, inode=128, location=/Users/MyUser/MyFile.txt

could be mounted as:
type=MOUNT, identifier=C
type=TSK, inode=128, location=/Users/MyUser/MyFile.txt

where the "C" mount point would be:
type=OS, location=/home/myuser/myimages/image.qcow2
type=QCOW
type=TSK_PARTITION, location=/p1
