dfVFS, or Digital Forensics Virtual File System, provides read-only access to
file-system objects from various storage media types and file formats. The goal
of dfVFS is to provide a generic interface for accessing file-system objects,
for which it uses several back-ends that provide the actual implementation of
the various storage media types, volume systems and file systems.

dfVFS originates from the Plaso project [https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso].
It was largely rewritten and made into a stand-alone project to provide more
flexibility and allow other projects to make use of the VFS functionality.
dfVFS originally was named PyVFS, but that name conflicted with another project.

dfVFS is currently developed and maintained by:
* Daniel White
* Joachim Metz

dfVFS depends on various other projects. So thanks to the authors and others
involved with these projects:
* Python and modules
* the SleuthKit
* pytsk

Test data:

* the contents of the *.exe and *.exe.mui files on bdetogo.raw has been
  filled with 0-byte values.
