description_short: Digital Forensics Virtual File System (dfVFS).
description_long: dfVFS, or Digital Forensics Virtual File System, provides read-only access to
    file-system objects from various storage media types and file formats. The goal
    of dfVFS is to provide a generic interface for accessing file-system objects,
    for which it uses several back-ends that provide the actual implementation of
    the various storage media types, volume systems and file systems.
